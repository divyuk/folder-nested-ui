## Event Propgation in Javacript

The `handlePropogation` function is used to stop the propagation of the click event. This is done using `e.stopPropagation()`. Let's break down why this is important and its use case in this scenario.

### Event Propagation in JavaScript

Event propagation is a mechanism that defines how events flow through the DOM tree. There are two main phases of event propagation:

1. **Capturing Phase:** The event starts from the root and flows down to the target element.
2. **Bubbling Phase:** The event starts from the target element and bubbles up to the root.

By default, most events bubble up, meaning they propagate from the target element up through its ancestors in the DOM.

### Scenario in Your Code

Here‚Äôs a simplified version of the relevant part of your code:

```jsx
const handlePropogation = (e) => {
  e.stopPropagation();
};

if (explorerData.isFolder) {
  return (
    <div style={{ marginTop: 5 }}>
      <div className="folder" onClick={() => setShow(!show)}>
        üìÅ {explorerData.name}
        <div>
          <button onClick={(e) => handlePropogation(e)}>Folder +</button>
          <button onClick={(e) => handlePropogation(e)}>File +</button>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### The Use of `stopPropagation`

In this code:

- The `div` with the class `folder` has an `onClick` event handler that toggles the `show` state.
- There are two buttons inside this `div`, each with an `onClick` event handler that calls `handlePropogation`.

When a button is clicked, the click event would naturally propagate (bubble up) to its parent elements. Without stopping propagation:

1. Clicking the "Folder +" or "File +" button would trigger the `handlePropogation` function.
2. After that, the event would continue to bubble up and trigger the `onClick` event of the parent `div` with the class `folder`, causing `setShow(!show)` to execute.

This would lead to an unintended toggling of the `show` state whenever either button is clicked.

By calling `e.stopPropagation()` within the `handlePropogation` function, you prevent the event from bubbling up to the parent `div`. This means:

- The button‚Äôs click event is handled by `handlePropogation`, which stops further propagation.
- The `onClick` event on the parent `div` is not triggered, so `setShow(!show)` does not execute.

### Summary

Using `stopPropagation` here is crucial to ensure that the `setShow(!show)` function is only called when the `div` with the class `folder` is clicked directly, and not when any of the buttons inside it are clicked. This provides finer control over event handling and prevents unwanted side effects in the UI behavior.

The onBlur event in JavaScript and React is an event handler that is triggered when an element loses focus. Focus can be lost in various ways, such as when the user clicks outside the element, navigates to another element using the keyboard, or otherwise causes the element to no longer be the active element.
